A first version of this paper was posted as a [preprint on Research Square](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-102861/v1).


**Thermodynamic model:**

We include the data on which the thermodynamic models were fitted.

- Files named `adsorption-*.txt` in the [`thermodynamic_model/`](thermodynamic_model/) folder contain the adsorption and desorption data for C₂H₂. The filename indicates the system composition and measurement temperature. The two columns are the pressure (in units of kPa) and the excess adsorption (in units of cm³/g).
- The resulting fit parameters are given in Supplementary Table 3.
