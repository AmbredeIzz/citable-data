A first version of this paper was posted as a [preprint on chemRxiv](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.7081151.v1).

**Computational files:**
- [`energy_strain.txt`](energy_strain.txt): data from Figure 2, as calculated from DFT.
- [`optatom.d12`](optatom.d12): geometry optimization (atomic positions only, fixed unit cell parameters) of PDAC-MOF structure with solvent removed.
- [`strain.d12`](strain.d12): geometry optimization (atomic positions only, fixed unit cell parameters) of strained PDAC-MOF structure (–2% strain along _a_ axis).

Calculations were run with [CRYSTAL14](http://www.crystal.unito.it/), version 1.0.4, parallel version on 64-bit GNU/Linux system.
