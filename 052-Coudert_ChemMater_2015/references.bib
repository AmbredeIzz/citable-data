abstract={The chemistry of the coordination polymers has in recent years advanced extensively, affording various architectures, which are constructed from a variety of molecular building blocks with different interactions between them. The next challenge is the chemical and physical functionalization of these architectures, through the porous properties of the frameworks. This review concentrates on three aspects of coordination polymers: 1) the use of crystal engineering to construct porous frameworks from connectors and linkers ("nanospace engineering"), 2) characterizing and cataloging the porous properties by functions for storage, exchange, separation, etc., and 3) the next generation of porous functions based on dynamic crystal transformations caused by guest molecules or physical stimuli. Our aim is to present the state of the art chemistry and physics of and in the micropores of porous coordination polymers.},

The literature describing these effects is comprehensively surveyed, including a categorization of each report according to the type of luminescence observed. Finally, we discuss potential applications of luminescent MOFs.

abstract={A comprehensive overview of the different types of luminescent Metal-Organic frameworks (MOF), particularly those with interesting and important applications, is presented. Studies have found that efficient lanthanide-centered luminescence of MOFs is fulfilled by the use of antenna organic linkers, and it is necessary that the lowest triplet state of the organic linkers is located at an energy level nearly equal to or above the resonance level of the lanthanide ion. Sun et al. prepared a series of Ln-Cd HMOFs that display 1D helical channels occupied by water molecules and SO 4 2- anions and helical tubes constructed from three distinct helical chains. Xu et al. also discussed and explained the possible sensing mechanism by the matching degree of TbNTA-3H 2O with different anions. Harbuzaru et al. reported a new MOF named ITQMOF-1-Eu with 4,40-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)bis(benzoicacid) as ligand, which crystallizes in long needles that can be handled individually.},

abstract={The field of host-guest complexation is intensely attractive from diverse perspectives, including materials science, chemistry and biology. The uptake and encapsulation of guest species by host frameworks are being investigated for a wide variety of purposes, including separation and storage using zeolites, and recognition and sensing by enzymes in solution. Here we focus on the concept of the cooperative integration of 'softness' and 'regularity'. Recent developments on porous coordination polymers (or metal-organic frameworks) have provided the inherent properties that combine these features. Such soft porous crystals exhibit dynamic frameworks that are able to respond to external stimuli such as light, electric fields or the presence of particular species, but they are also crystalline and can change their channels reversibly while retaining high regularity. We discuss the relationship between the structures and properties of these materials in view of their practical applications. © 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The first three-dimensional chromium(III) dicarboxylate, MIL-53as or CrIII(OH)·{O2C-C6 H4-CO2}· {HO2C-C6H4-CO2H}0.75, has been obtained under hydrothermal conditions (as: as-synthesized). The free acid can be removed by calcination giving the resulting solid, MIL-53ht or CrIII(OH)·{O2C-C6 H4-CO2}. At room temperature, MIL-53ht adsorbs atmospheric water immediately to give CraIII(OH)·{O2C-C6 H4-CO2}· H2O or MIL-53lt (It: low-temperature form, ht: high-temperature form). Both structures, which have been determined by using x-ray powder diffraction data, are built up from chains of chromium(III) octahedra linked through terephthalate dianions. This creates a three-dimensional structure with an array of one-dimensional large pore channels filled with free disordered terephthalic molecules (MIL-53as) or water molecules (MIL-53lt); when the free molecules are removed, this leads to a nanoporous solid (MIL-53ht) with a Langmuir surface area over 1500 m2/g. The transition between the hydrated form (MIL-53lt) and the anhydrous solid (MIL-53ht) is fully reversible and followed by a very high breathing effect (more than 5 Å), the pores being clipped in the presence of water molecules (MIL-53lt) and reopened when the channels are empty (MIL-53ht). The thermal behavior of the two solids has been investigated using TGA and x-ray thermodiffractometry. The sorption properties of MIL-53lt have also been studied using several organic solvents. Finally, magnetism measurements performed on MIL-53as and MIL-53lt revealed that these two phases are antiferromagnetic with Néel temperatures TN of 65 and 55 K, respectively. Crystal data for MIL-53as is as follows: orthorhombic space group Pnam with a = 17.340(1) Å, b = 12.178(1) Å, c = 6.822(1) Å, and Z = 4. Crystal data for MIL-53ht is as follows: orthorhombic space group Imcm with a = 16.733(1) Å, b = 13.038(1) Å, c = 6.812(1) Å, and Z = 4. Crystal data for MIL-53lt is as follows: monoclinic space group C2/c with a = 19.685(4) Å, b = 7.849(1) Å, c = 6.782(1) Å, β = 104.90(1)°, and Z = 4.},

abstract={A systematic modulation of organic ligands connecting dinuclear paddle-wheel motifs leads to a series of isomorphous metal-organic porous materials that have a three-dimensional connectivity and interconnected pores. Aromatic dicarboxylates such as 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate (1,4-bdc), tetra-methylterephthalate (tmbdc), 1,4-naphthalenedicarboxylate (1,4-ndc), tetrafluoroterephthalate (tfbdc), or 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylate (2,6-ndc) are linear linkers that form two-dimensional layers, and diamine ligands, 4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (dabco) or 4,4′-dipyridyl (bpy), coordinate at both sides of Zn2 paddle-wheel units to bridge the layers vertically. The resulting open frameworks [Zn2(1,4-bdc)2-(dabco)] (1), [Zn2(1,4-bdc)(tmbdc)-(dabco)] (2), [Zn2(tmbdc) 2(dabco)] (3), [Zn2(1,4-ndc)2(dabco)] (4), [Zn2-(tfbdc)2(dabco)] (5), and [Zn2(tmbdc) 2-(bpy)] (8) possess varying size of pores and free apertures originating from the side groups of the 1,4-bdc derivatives. [Zn 2(1,4-bdc)2(bpy)] (6) and [Zn2(2,6-ndc) 2(bpy)] (7) have two- and threefold interpenetrating structures, respectively.

abstract={Hydrothermal stability is a pertinent issue to address for many industrial applications where percent levels of water can be present at temperatures ranging from subambient to several hundred degrees. Our objective is to understand relative stabilities of MOF materials through experimental testing combined with molecular modeling. This will enable the ultimate design of materials with improved hydrothermal stability, while maintaining the properties of interest. The tools that we have employed for these studies include quantum mechanical calculations based upon cluster models and combinatorial steaming methods whereby a steam stability map was formulated according to the relative stability of different materials. The experimental steaming method allows for high throughput screening of materials stability over a broad range of steam levels as well as in-depth investigation of structural transformations under more highly resolved conditions, while the cluster model presented here yields the correct trends in hydrothermal stability. Good agreement was observed between predicted relative stabilities of materials by molecular modeling and experimental results. Fundamental information from these studies has provided insight into how metal composition and coordination, chemical functionality of organic linker, framework dimensionality, and interpenetration affect the relative stabilities of PCP materials. This work suggests that the strength of the bond between the metal oxide cluster and the bridging linker is important in determining the hydrothermal stability of the PCP. Although the flexibility of the framework plays a role, it is not as important as the metal-linker bond strength. This demonstration of alignment between experimental and calculated observations has proven the validity of the method, and the insight derived herein insight facilitates direction in designing ideal MOF materials with improved hydrothermal stability for desired applications. © 2009 American Chemical Society.},

By flexing like lattice fencing, the framework couples this to a contraction along a perpendicular direction. This gives negative thermal expansion that is 14 times larger than in ZrW2O 8.

abstract={The mechanical properties of hybrid framework materials, including both nanoporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and dense inorganic-organic frameworks, are discussed in this critical review. Although there are relatively few studies of this kind in the literature, major recent advances in this area are beginning to shed light on the fundamental structure-mechanical property relationships. Indeed research into the mechanical behavior of this important new class of solid-state materials is central to the design and optimal performance of a multitude of technological applications envisaged. In this review, we examine the elasticity of hybrid frameworks by considering their Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, bulk modulus and shear modulus. This is followed by discussions of their hardness, plasticity, yield strength and fracture behavior. Our focus is on both experimental and computational approaches. Experimental work on single crystals and amorphized monoliths involved primarily the application of nanoindentation and atomic force microscopy to determine the elastic moduli and hardness properties. The compressibility and bulk moduli of single crystals and polycrystalline powders were studied by high-pressure X-ray crystallography in the diamond anvil cell, while in one instance spectroscopic ellipsometry has also been used to estimate the elastic moduli of MOF nanoparticles and deposited films. Theoretical studies, on the other hand, encompassed the application of first principles density-functional calculations and finite-temperature molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, by virtue of the diverse mechanical properties achievable in hybrid framework materials, we propose that a new domain be established in the materials selection map to define this emerging class of materials (137 references). © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Advances in flexible and functional metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), also called soft porous crystals, are reviewed by covering the literature of the five years period 2009-2013 with reference to the early pertinent work since the late 1990s. Flexible MOFs combine the crystalline order of the underlying coordination network with cooperative structural transformability. These materials can respond to physical and chemical stimuli of various kinds in a tunable fashion by molecular design, which does not exist for other known solid-state materials. Among the fascinating properties are so-called breathing and swelling phenomena as a function of host-guest interactions. Phase transitions are triggered by guest adsorption/desorption, photochemical, thermal, and mechanical stimuli. Other important flexible properties of MOFs, such as linker rotation and sub-net sliding, which are not necessarily accompanied by crystallographic phase transitions, are briefly mentioned as well. Emphasis is given on reviewing the recent progress in application of in situ characterization techniques and the results of theoretical approaches to characterize and understand the breathing mechanisms and phase transitions. The flexible MOF systems, which are discussed, are categorized by the type of metal-nodes involved and how their coordination chemistry with the linker molecules controls the framework dynamics. Aspects of tailoring the flexible and responsive properties by the mixed component solid-solution concept are included, and as well examples of possible applications of flexible metal-organic frameworks for separation, catalysis, sensing, and biomedicine.

abstract={The metal-organic framework, MIL-53, can have a structural transition from an open-pored to a closed-pored structure by adsorbing different guest molecules. The aid of guest molecules is believed to be necessary to initiate this "breathing" effect. Using both neutron powder diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering techniques, we find that MIL-53 exhibits a reversible structural transition between an openpored and a closed-pored structure as a function of temperature without the presence of any guest molecules. Surprisingly, this structural transition shows a significant temperature hysteresis: the transition from the open-pored to closed-pored structure occurs at approximately 125 to 150 K, while the transition from the closed-pored to open-pored structure occurs around 325 to 375 K. To our knowledge, this is first observation of such a large temperature hysteresis of a structural transition in metal-organic frameworks. We also note that the transition from the open to closed structure at low temperature shows very slow kinetics. An ab initio computer simulation is employed to investigate the possible mechanism of the transition. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Porous coordination polymers, in particular flexible porous coordination polymer networks that change their network structure on guest adsorption, have enormous potential in applications involving selective storage, separation and sensing. Despite the expected significant differences in their adsorption properties, porous coordination polymer nanocrystals remain largely unexplored, and there have been no reports about studies on flexible porous coordination polymer nanocrystals, mainly due to a lack of preparation methods. Here, we present a new technique for the rapid preparation of porous coordination polymer nanocrystals that combines non-aqueous inverse microemulsion with ultrasonication. Uniform nanocrystals of {[Zn(ip)(bpy)]}n (ip = isophthalate, bpy = 4,4′-bipyridyl; CID-1), a flexible porous coordination polymer, have been prepared by this method and analysed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray powder diffraction. A model for particle formation and growth is presented and discussed. Adsorption experiments with methanol show that the overall adsorption capacities of nanoparticles and bulk are almost identical, but the shapes of the sorption isotherms differ significantly and the adsorption kinetics increase dramatically. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract={We provide a general thermodynamic framework for the understanding of guest-induced structural transitions in hybrid organic-inorganic materials. The method is based on the analysis of experimental adsorption isotherms. It allows the determination of the free energy differences between host structures involved in guest-induced transitions, especially hard to obtain experimentally. We discuss the general case of adsorption in flexible materials and show how a few key quantities, such as pore volumes and adsorption affinities, entirely determine the phenomenology of adsorption, including the occurrence of structural transitions. On the basis of adsorption thermodynamics, we then propose a taxonomy of guest-induced structural phase transitions and the corresponding isotherms. In particular, we derive generic conditions for observing a double structural transition upon adsorption, often resulting in a two-step isotherm. Finally, we show the wide applicability and the robustness of the model through three case studies of topical hybrid organic-inorganic frameworks: the hysteretic hydrogen adsorption in Co(1,4-benzenedipyrazolate), the guest-dependent gate-opening in Cu(4,4′-bipyridine)(2,5- dihydroxybenzoate)2 and the CO2-induced "breathing" of hybrid material MIL-53. © 2008 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={(Graph Presented) The impact of modest, industrially accessible pressures (0-1.2 GPa) on the structure and porosity of the zeolitic imidazolate framework Zn(2-methylimidazole)2, ZIF-8, was investigated using in situ powder X-ray diffraction in combination with sorption measurements for pressure-treated samples. The framework is highly compressible, with a bulk modulus (K = -V ∂P/∂V) of 6.52(35) GPa, the most compressible metal-organic framework (MOF) documented to date. The framework undergoes an irreversible pressure-induced amorphization following compression beyond 0.34 GPa. The pressure-amorphized ZIF-8 remains porous, although the sorption characteristics are distinctly altered compared to the pristine material. As such, pressure can provide a new route to systematically modify the sorption behavior and other functional properties of MOFs, a nontraditional form of postsynthetic modification. Importantly, pressure modification of MOFs is effective at lower pressures than in other porous materials (e.g., zeolites) and, as such, is easily scalable and industrially relevant. © 2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Flexible porous coordination polymers change their structure in response to molecular incorporation but recover their original configuration after the guest has been removed. We demonstrated that the crystal downsizing of twofold interpenetrated frameworks of [Cu2(dicarboxylate)2(amine)] n regulates the structural flexibility and induces a shape-memory effect in the coordination frameworks. In addition to the two structures that contribute to the sorption process (that is, a nonporous closed phase and a guest-included open phase), we isolated an unusual, metastable open dried phase when downsizing the crystals to the mesoscale, and the closed phase was recovered by thermal treatment. Crystal downsizing suppressed the structural mobility and stabilized the open dried phase. The successful isolation of two interconvertible empty phases, the closed phase and the open dried phase, provided switchable sorption properties with or without gate-opening behavior.},

The computationally assisted structure determinations reveal structural changes involving the orientation of the benzene rings relative to the pyrazolate rings, the dihedral angles for the pyrazolate rings bound at the metal centers, and a change in the metal coordination geometry from square planar to tetrahedral. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements and in situ infrared and UV-vis-NIR spectroscopic measurements provide strong corroborating evidence for the observed changes in structure. In addition, the results from in situ microcalorimetry measurements show that an additional heat of 2 kJ/mol is required for each of the first four transitions, while 7 kJ/mol is necessary for the last step involving the transformation of CoII from square planar to tetrahedral. Based on the enthalpy, a weak N2 interaction with the open CoII coordination sites is proposed for the first four phases, which is supported by Monte Carlo simulations. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The nanoporous metal-organic framework material Cu3(1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate)2(H2O)3•{guest} exhibits anomalous compression under applied pressure that is associated with the hyper-filling of the pore network. This behavior involves a dramatic transition between a "hard" regime (bulk modulus, Khard ≈ 118 GPa), where the pressure-transmitting fluid penetrates the framework cavities, and a "soft" regime (Ksoft ≈ 30 GPa), where the guest-framework system compresses concertedly. Not only is the duality in compressibility triggered by the availability of potential guests but the size/penetrability of the guest molecules determines the pressure at which the hard-soft transition occurs. Specifically, the observed compression behavior depends on the size of the pressure-transmitting fluid molecules, the sample particle size (i.e., the extent of the pore network), and the rate at which the pressure is increased. The unprecedentedpressure-induced phenomena documented here, illustrates the exotic high-pressure behaviors possible in this versatile class of advanced functional materials with broad implications for their structure-function relationships and accordingly their practical application.

abstract={We present the results of quantitative variable-temperature neutron powder diffraction experiments performed on the OSIRIS instrument at the ISIS facility on the pure silica zeolites chabazite and ITQ-4. Chabazite has been found to be one of the most strongly contracting materials known, with a linear expansion coefficient αv/3 varying from -0.5 × 10-6 to -16.7 × 10-6 K-1 over the temperature range 293-873 K. Full Rietveld refinement has been carried out using three different refinement strategies: free isotropic refinements, refinement using geometrical restraints, and a rigid body refinement. The free isotropic refinement was found to be the most successful. In agreement with previous studies on ZrW2O8 and Sc2(WO4)3 type materials, we suggest that changes in Si-O-Si interpolyhedral bond angles are the driving force for the contraction mechanism.

The transformation occurs on heating the crystal at «130 °C. This uncommon behavior was also studied by thermal methods, FTIR spectroscopy, and thermodiffrac-tometry. Both polymorphs, a (room-temperature form) and b (high-temperature form), are proven to be active heterogeneous catalysts; the higher catalytic activity of b is owed to a decrease in the Yb coordination number.

abstract={We present a unified thermodynamic description of the breathing transitions between large pore (lp) and narrow pore (np) phases of MIL-53 (Cr) observed during the adsorption of guest molecules and the mechanical compression in the process of mercury porosimetry. By revisiting recent experimental data on mercury intrusion and in situ XRD during CO2 adsorption, we demonstrate that the magnitude of the adsorption stress exerted inside the pores by guest molecules, which is required for inducing the breathing transition, corresponds to the magnitude of the external pressure applied from the outside that causes the respective transformation between lp and np phases. We show that, when a stimulus is applied to breathing MOFs of MIL-53 type, these materials exhibit small reversible elastic deformations of lp and np phases of the order of 2-4%, while the breathing transition is associated with irreversible plastic deformation that leads to up to ∼40% change of the sample volume and a pronounced hysteresis.

This anisotropy can reach a 4001 ratio between the most rigid and weakest directions, in stark contrast to the case of nonflexible MOFs such as MOF-5 and ZIF-8.

With the use of neutron powder diffraction, we have discovered and characterized both NLC and extremely anisotropic thermal expansion, including negative thermal expansion (NTE) along the NLC axis, in a simple molecular crystal (the deuterated 1:1 compound of methanol and water). Apically linked rhombuses, which are formed by the bridging of hydroxyl-water chains with methyl groups, extend along the axis of NLC/NTE and lead to the observed behavior.},

abstract={Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations have been used to predict structural transitions of the breathing metal-organic framework (MOF) MIL-53(Sc) in response to changes in temperature over the range 100-623 K and adsorption of CO2 at 0-0.9 bar at 196 K. The method has for the first time been shown to predict successfully both temperature-dependent structural changes and the structural response to variable sorbate uptake of a flexible MOF. AIMD employing dispersion-corrected density functional theory accurately simulated the experimentally observed closure of MIL-53(Sc) upon solvent removal and the transition of the empty MOF from the closed-pore phase to the very-narrow-pore phase (symmetry change from P21/c to C2/c) with increasing temperature, indicating that it can directly take into account entropic as well as enthalpic effects. We also used AIMD simulations to mimic the CO2 adsorption of MIL-53(Sc) in silico by allowing the MIL-53(Sc) framework to evolve freely in response to CO2 loadings corresponding to the two steps in the experimental adsorption isotherm. The resulting structures enabled the structure determination of the two CO2-containing intermediate and large-pore phases observed by experimental synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies with increasing CO2 pressure; this would not have been possible for the intermediate structure via conventional methods because of diffraction peak broadening. Furthermore, the strong and anisotropic peak broadening observed for the intermediate structure could be explained in terms of fluctuations of the framework predicted by the AIMD simulations. Fundamental insights from the molecular-level interactions further revealed the origin of the breathing of MIL-53(Sc) upon temperature variation and CO2 adsorption. These simulations illustrate the power of the AIMD method for the prediction and understanding of the behavior of flexible microporous solids. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={ConspectusCrystalline metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous frameworks comprising an infinite array of metal nodes connected by organic linkers. The number of novel MOF structures reported per year is now in excess of 6000, despite significant increases in the complexity of both component units and molecular networks. Their regularly repeating structures give rise to chemically variable porous architectures, which have been studied extensively due to their sorption and separation potential. More recently, catalytic applications have been proposed that make use of their chemical tunability, while reports of negative linear compressibility and negative thermal expansion have further expanded interest in the field.Amorphous metal-organic frameworks (aMOFs) retain the basic building blocks and connectivity of their crystalline counterparts, though they lack any long-range periodic order. Aperiodic arrangements of atoms result in their X-ray diffraction patterns being dominated by broad "humps" caused by diffuse scattering and thus they are largely indistinguishable from one another. Amorphous MOFs offer many exciting opportunities for practical application, either as novel functional materials themselves or facilitating other processes, though the domain is largely unexplored (total aMOF reported structures amounting to under 30).Specifically, the use of crystalline MOFs to detect harmful guest species before subsequent stress-induced collapse and guest immobilization is of considerable interest, while functional luminescent and optically active glass-like materials may also be prepared in this manner. The ion transporting capacity of crystalline MOFs might be improved during partial structural collapse, while there are possibilities of preparing superstrong glasses and hybrid liquids during thermal amorphization. The tuning of release times of MOF drug delivery vehicles by partial structural collapse may be possible, and aMOFs are often more mechanically robust than crystalline materials, which is of importance for industrial applications.In this Account, we describe the preparation of aMOFs by introduction of disorder into their parent crystalline frameworks through heating, pressure (both hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic), and ball-milling. The main method of characterizing these amorphous materials (analysis of the pair distribution function) is summarized, alongside complementary techniques such as Raman spectroscopy. Detailed investigations into their properties (both chemical and mechanical) are compiled and compared with those of crystalline MOFs, while the impact of the field on the processing techniques used for crystalline MOF powders is also assessed. Crucially, the benefits amorphization may bring to existing proposed MOF applications are detailed, alongside the possibilities and research directions afforded by the combination of the unique properties of the amorphous domain with the versatility of MOF chemistry. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The synthesis and structure of an azobenzene functionalized isoreticular metal-organic framework (azo-IRMOF-74-III) [Mg2(C26H 16O6N2)] are described and the ability to controllably release a guest from its pores in response to an external stimulus has been demonstrated. Azo-IRMOF-74-III is an isoreticular expansion of MOF-74 with an etb topology and a 1-D hexagonal pore structure. The structure of azo-IRMOF-74-III is analogous to that of MOF-74, as demonstrated by powder X-ray diffraction, with a surface area of 2410 m2 g-1 BET. Each organic unit within azo-IRMOF-74-III is decorated with a photoswitchable azobenzene unit, which can be toggled between its cis and trans conformation by excitation at 408 nm. When propidium iodide dye was loaded into the MOF, spectroscopic studies showed that no release of the luminescent dye was observed under ambient conditions. Upon irradiation of the MOF at 408 nm, however, the rapid wagging motion inherent to the repetitive isomerization of the azobenzene functionality triggered the release of the dye from the pores. This light-induced release of cargo can be modulated between an on and an off state by controlling the conformation of the azobenzene with the appropriate wavelength of light. This report highlights the ability to capture and release small molecules and demonstrates the utility of self-contained photo-active switches located inside highly porous MOFs. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={The counterintuitive phenomenon of negative linear compressibility (NLC) is a highly desirable but rare property exploitable in the development of artificial muscles, actuators and next-generation pressure sensors. In all cases, material performance is directly related to the magnitude of intrinsic NLC response. Here we show the molecular framework material zinc(II) dicyanoaurate(I), Zn[Au(CN) 2 ] 2, exhibits the most extreme and persistent NLC behaviour yet reported: under increasing hydrostatic pressure its crystal structure expands in one direction at a rate that is an order of magnitude greater than both the typical contraction observed for common engineering materials and also the anomalous expansion in established NLC candidates. This extreme behaviour arises from the honeycomb-like structure of Zn[Au(CN) 2 ] 2 coupling volume reduction to uniaxial expansion, and helical Au...Au 'aurophilic' interactions accommodating abnormally large linear strains by functioning as supramolecular springs. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract={A combination of variable-temperature and variable-pressure single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction is used to study the thermo- and piezo-mechanical properties of the metal-organic framework (MOF) silver(i) 2-methylimidazolate, Ag(mim). We find the material to exhibit a number of anomalous mechanical properties: negative thermal expansion, colossal positive thermal expansion and the most extreme negative linear compressibility yet observed for a MOF. By considering the mechanical response of individual supramolecular motifs we are able to rationalise the varied and unconventional behaviour of the bulk material. A general inverse correspondence between strength of supramolecular interaction and magnitude of mechanical response is identified. We propose that the consideration of MOF structures in terms of their underlying mechanical building units provides a straightforward qualitative method of directing framework design in order to maximise anomalous mechanical response. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={Using Brillouin scattering, we measured the single-crystal elastic constants (C ij's) of a prototypical metal-organic framework (MOF): zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-8 [Zn(2-methylimidazolate) 2], which adopts a zeolitic sodalite topology and exhibits large porosity. Its C ij's under ambient conditions are (in GPa) C 11=9.522(7), C 12=6.865(14), and C 44=0.967(4). Tensorial analysis of the C ij's reveals the complete picture of the anisotropic elasticity in cubic ZIF-8. We show that ZIF-8 has a remarkably low shear modulus G min1GPa, which is the lowest yet reported for a single-crystalline extended solid. Using ab initio calculations, we demonstrate that ZIF-8's C ij's can be reliably predicted, and its elastic deformation mechanism is linked to the pliant ZnN 4 tetrahedra. Our results shed new light on the role of elastic constants in establishing the structural stability of MOF materials and thus their suitability for practical applications. © 2012 American Physical Society.},

abstract={Three crystalline lanthanide(III) coordination polymers and their high quality single crystals with empirical formula [M2(BDOA) 3(H2O)4]·6H2O [M = Tb (1), Gd (2), and Sm (3); BDOA = benzene-1,4-dioxylacetate] were obtained via the agar gel diffusion method. Their compositions and structures were determined and analyzed in detail by infrared spectroscopy, elemental analysis, and the single-crystal X-ray diffraction method. The ligand has two crystallographically independent coordination modes, La and Lb (L denotes BDOA); the metal centers are connected with La to form a double helix; these act as secondary building units (SBUs), which are linked by L b resulting in a plane topology geometry with 54-membered macrorings; and each metal ion is saturated by water molecules to form a nine-coordinated sphere. These planes are further constructed into three-dimensional networks by a complicated H-bond system with an inversion center among the water molecules (coordinated and guest), the carboxylate group, and the phenolic O atoms. Investigations of their luminescent properties demonstrate that compound 1 has characteristic emissions of Tb(III) corresponding to electronic transitions from the excited state 5D4 to the multiplets 7F6, 7F5, 7F4, and 7F3, respectively; however, 2 and 3 have no detectable luminescence under the same conditions. Thermal decomposition and powder X-ray diffraction results indicate that the transformation from the crystal form, [M2(BDOA)3(H2O) 4]·6H2O, to the amorphous powder, M 2(BDOA)3(H2O)2, is reversible, indicating that the amorphous form, M2(BDOA)3(H 2O)2, may be utilized as an absorbing agent for water and water vapor. © 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Occasional, large amplitude flexibility in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is one of the most intriguing recent discoveries in chemistry and material science. Yet, there is at present no theoretical framework that permits the identification of flexible structures in the rapidly expanding universe of MOFs. Here, we propose a simple method to predict whether a MOF is flexible, based on treating it as a system of rigid elements, connected by hinges. This proposition is correct in application to MOFs based on rigid carboxylate linkers. We validate the method by correctly classifying known experimental MOFs into rigid and flexible groups. Applied to hypothetical MOFs, the method reveals an abundance of flexibility phenomena, and this seems to be at odds with the proportion of flexible structures among experimentally known MOFs. We speculate that the flexibility of a MOF may constitute an intrinsic impediment on its experimental realization. This highlights the importance of systematic prediction of large amplitude flexibility regimes in MOFs. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The structural change and resilience of a single crystal of a metal-organic framework (MOF), Zn(HO3PC4H8PO 3H)·2H2O (ZAG-4), was investigated under high pressures (0-9.9 GPa) using in situ single crystal X-ray diffraction. Although the unit cell volume decreases over 27%, the quality of the single crystal is retained and the unit cell parameters revert to their original values after pressure has been removed. This framework is considerably compressible with a bulk modulus calculated at ∼11.7 GPa. The b-axis also exhibits both positive and negative linear compressibility. Within the applied pressures investigated, there was no discernible failure or amorphization point for this compound. The alkyl chains in the structure provide a spring-like cushion to stabilize the compression of the system allowing for large distortions in the metal coordination environment, without destruction of the material. This intriguing observation only adds to the current speculation as to whether or not MOFs may find a role as a new class of piezofunctional solid-state materials for application as highly sensitive pressure sensors, shock absorbing materials, pressure switches, or smart body armor. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Using a combination of single-crystal and powder X-ray diffraction measurements, we study temperature- and pressure-driven structural distortions in zinc(II) cyanide (Zn(CN)2) and cadmium(II) imidazolate (Cd(im)2), two molecular frameworks with the anticuprite topology. Under a hydrostatic pressure of 1.52 GPa, Zn(CN)2 undergoes a first-order displacive phase transition to an orthorhombic phase, with the corresponding atomic displacements characterized by correlated collective tilts of pairs of Zn-centered tetrahedra. This displacement pattern sheds light on the mechanism of negative thermal expansion in ambient-pressure Zn(CN)2. We find that the fundamental mechanical response exhibited by Zn(CN) 2 is mirrored in the temperature-dependent behavior of Cd(im) 2. Our results suggest that the thermodynamics of molecular frameworks may be governed by considerations of packing efficiency while also depending on dynamic instabilities of the underlying framework topology. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={A novel three-dimensional metal-organic framework (MOF) that displays anisotropic thermal expansion has been prepared and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCD) and thermal analysis. The as-prepared MOF has one-dimensional channels containing guest molecules that can be removed and/or exchanged for other guest molecules in a single-crystal to single-crystal fashion. When the original guest molecules are replaced there is a noticeable effect on the host mechanics, altering the thermal expansion properties of the material. This study of the thermal expansion coefficients of different inclusion complexes of the host MOF involved systematic alteration of guest size, i.e., methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, and isopropanol, showing that fine control over the thermal expansion coefficients can be achieved and that the coefficients can be correlated with the size of the guest. As a proof of concept, this study demonstrates the realizable principle that a single-crystal material with an exchangeable guest component (as opposed to a composite) may be used to achieve a tunable thermal expansion coefficient. In addition, this study demonstrates that greater variance in the absolute dimensions of a crystal can be achieved when one has two variables that affect it, i.e., the host-guest interactions and temperature. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Pressure-induced phase transformations (PIPTs) occur in a wide range of materials. In general, the bonding characteristics, before and after the PIPT, remain invariant in most materials, and the bond rearrangement is usually irreversible due to the strain induced under pressure. A reversible PIPT associated with a substantial bond rearrangement has been found in a metal-organic framework material, namely [tmenH2][Er(HCOO) 4]2 (tmenH2 2+=N,N,N',N'- tetramethylethylenediammonium).

High-pressure single-crystal X-ray diffraction studies reveal the complex bond rearrangement through the transition. The reversible nature of the transition is confirmed by means of independent nanoindentation measurements on single crystals. A reversible pressure-induced phase transformation associated with a substantial bond rearrangement is discovered in the metal-organic framework [tmenH 2][Er(HCOO)4]2 (tmenH2 2+=N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediammonium).

abstract={We present here a framework for the analysis of the full tensors of second-order elastic constants of metal-organic frameworks, which can be obtained by ab initio calculations. We describe the various mechanical properties one can derive from such tensors: directional Youngs modulus, shear modulus, Poisson ratio, and linear compressibility. We then apply this methodology to four different metal-organic frameworks displaying a wine-rack structure: MIL-53(Al), MIL-47, MIL-122(In), and MIL-140A. From these results, we shed some light into the link between mechanical properties, geometric shape, and compliance of the framework of these porous solids. We conclude by proposing a simple criterion to assess the framework compliance, based on the lowest eigenvalue of its second-order elastic tensor. © 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

These materials were investigated via temperature-dependent adsorption/desorption of CO monitored by FTIR spectroscopy under ultra-high-vacuum conditions. Accurate structural models for the generated point defects at CUS were deduced by matching experimental data with theoretical simulation. The results reveal multivariate diversity of electronic and steric properties at CUS, demonstrating the MOF defect structure modulation at two length scales in a single step to overcome restricted active site specificity and confined coordination space at CUS. Moreover, the DEMOFs exhibit promising modified physical properties, including band gap, magnetism, and porosity, with hierarchical micro/mesopore structures correlated with the nature and the degree of defective linker incorporation into the framework. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

By measuring the elastic constants of ZIF-8 up to the amorphization pressure, we show that the crystal-to-amorphous transition is triggered by the mechanical instability of ZIF-8 under compression, due to shear mode softening of the material. No similar softening was observed under temperature increase, explaining the absence of temperature-induced amorphization in ZIF-8. We also demonstrate the large impact of the presence of adsorbate in the pores on the mechanical stability and compressibility of the framework, increasing its shear stability. This first molecular dynamics study of ZIF mechanical properties under variations of pressure, temperature, and pore filling opens the way to a more comprehensive understanding of their mechanical stability, structural transitions, and amorphization. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Two structurally different Er-formate frameworks, one NaCl-like [dmenH 2][Er(HCOO)4]2 (1) and the other pillared-layer type [tmenH2][Er(HCOO)4]2 (2), were obtained when templated by the corresponding protonated N,N′- dimethylethylenediamine (dmenH2) and N,N,N′,N′- tetramethyl- ethylenediamine (tmenH2). The shape and size of the template cations dictate the different coordination geometries of erbium and consequently the framework topologies, though erbium adopts eight coordination in the two compounds. In the NaCl-like structure of 1, erbium is coordinated by eight anti-anti bridging formates in a square antiprism, while in the pillared-layer structure of 2, it is coordinated by six anti-anti bridging formates and one chelating formate in a pentagonal bipyramid. 2 exhibits a structural phase transition around -70°C which is related to the disorder-order transition of the template cation. Both compounds behave as paramagnets between 2 and 300 K. However, they display field-dependent ac-susceptibilities with complicated field-induced magnetic relaxation processes, and the major slow ones probably results from spin-lattice relaxation. © 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

XRPD and N 2 sorption measurements confirm the intactness of the framework and the successful covalent modification was proven by IR- and NMR-spectroscopy. Furthermore, cis/trans isomerisation upon irradiation with light was demonstrated by UV/Vis spectroscopy. More distinct changes in the UV/Vis spectra were observed for Cr-MIL-101-amide compared to Cr-MIL-101-urea, while the degree of functionalization, i.e. the number of reacted NH 2-groups, seems to have a less pronounced effect.

abstract={Materials with negative linear compressibility are sought for various technological applications. Such effects were reported mainly in framework materials. When heated, they typically contract in the same direction of negative linear compression. Here we show that this common inverse relationship rule does not apply to a three-dimensional metal-organic framework crystal, [Ag(ethylenediamine)]NO 3. In this material, the direction of the largest intrinsic negative linear compression yet observed in metal-organic frameworks coincides with the strongest positive thermal expansion. In the perpendicular direction, the large linear negative thermal expansion and the strongest crystal compressibility are collinear. This seemingly irrational positive relationship of temperature and pressure effects is explained and the mechanism of coupling of compressibility with expansivity is presented. The positive coupling between compression and thermal expansion in this material enhances its piezo-mechanical response in adiabatic process, which may be used for designing new artificial composites and ultrasensitive measuring devices. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract={Systematic exploration of the molecular framework material Zn(CN) 2 at high pressure has revealed several distinct series of transitions leading to five new phases: four crystalline and one amorphous. The structures of the new crystalline phases have been resolved through ab initio structural determination, combining charge flipping and direct space methods, based on synchrotron powder diffraction data. The specific transition activated under pressure depends principally on the pressure-transmitting fluid used. Without fluid or in large molecule fluids (e.g., isopropanol, ethanol, or fluorinert), the high-pressure behavior intrinsic to Zn(CN)2 is observed; the doubly interpenetrated diamondoid framework structure transforms to a distorted, orthorhombic polymorph, Zn(CN)2-II (Pbca) at ∼1.50-1.58 GPa with asymmetric displacement of the bridging CN ligand and reorientation of the Zn(C/N)4 tetrahedra. In small molecule fluids (e.g., water, methanol, methanol-ethanol-water), the nonporous interpenetrated Zn(CN)2 framework can undergo reconstructive transitions to porous, non-interpenetrated polymorphs with different topologies: diamondoid (dia-Zn(CN)2, Fd3m, Ptrans ∼ 1.2 GPa), londaleite (lon-Zn(CN)2, P63/mmc, Ptrans ∼ 0.9 GPa), and pyrite-like (pyr-Zn(CN)2, Pa3, Ptrans ∼ 1.8 GPa). Remarkably, these pressure-induced transitions are associated with near 2-fold volume expansions. While an increase in volume with pressure is counterintuitive, the resulting new phases contain large fluid-filled pores, such that the combined solid + fluid volume is reduced and the inefficiencies in space filling by the interpenetrated parent phase are eliminated. That both dia-Zn(CN)2 and lon-Zn(CN)2 phases were retained upon release to ambient pressure demonstrates the potential for application of hydrostatic pressures to interpenetrated framework systems as a novel means to generate new porous materials. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

Ethanol treatment on the hydrated form of [Cu(bpy) 2(BF4)2], which is a representative flexible MOF showing the fascinating gate phenomenon on CO2 sorption, induces an easier dehydration and a significant decrease in the CO2 gate pressure. The results of IR, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements indicated that water molecules in the lattice of the hydrated form can be removed even at room temperature after the ethanol treatment and the basic 2D layered structure remains with a slight interlayer expansion. The results of thermogravimetric (TG) and gas chromatograph/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analyses and of CO2 sorptions indicated that the change of the gate phenomenon was caused by a trace of residual ethanol molecules included in the structure.

The inclusions of guest odorant molecules in the guess-free, porous [In(OH)(bdc)]n microcrystals could have quenched the excitons through: (1) delocalization over the conjugated polymer backbone, (2) interchain energy migration in the solid state, and (3) a highly organized molecular stacking structure, attributed to the pore confinement of the analyte inside the molecular-sized cavities of [In(OH)(bdc)]n framework which facilitated strong interactions between the analyte (or the odorant) and the host framework. Therefore, specific guest-host stereochemical interactions would dictate the characteristic quenching response of a given analyte. Red shifts were observed for cumin-, cinnamon-, vanillin-, p-xylene-, m-xylene-, o-xylene-, water-, and ethanol-adsorbed samples of [In(OH)(bdc)]n microcrystals, with emission λmax at 390, 425, 343, 428, 422, 400, 390, and 389 nm respectively, upon excitation at 270 nm in solid state. A second set of PL emission responses of the same analytes produced from the analyte-adsorbed Zn4O(bdc)3 (MOF-5) microcrystals for a demonstration purpose was also determined and coplotted with the first set of PL emission values to construct a 2D map of PL emission responses for our MOF-based "biomimetic nose". The biomimetic nose could distinguish the odors of the analytes based on a pattern recognition method (i.e., principal component analysis) because on the 2D map of PL emission responses, ethanol, m-xylene, o-xylene, vanillin, cumin, p-xylene, cinnamon, and water, were represented by a line, a point, a point, a point, a line, a point, a rectangle and a point respectively. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Nanoporous frameworks are polymeric materials built from rigid molecules, which give rise to their nanoporous structures with applications in gas sorption and storage, catalysis and others. Conceptually new applications could emerge, should these beneficial properties be manipulated by external stimuli in a reversible manner. One approach to render nanoporous frameworks responsive to external signals would be to immobilize molecular switches within their nanopores. Although the majority of molecular switches require conformational freedom to isomerize, and switching in the solid state is prohibited, the nanopores may provide enough room for the switches to efficiently isomerize. Here we describe two families of nanoporous materials incorporating the spiropyran molecular switch. These materials exhibit a variety of interesting properties, including reversible photochromism and acidochromism under solvent-free conditions, light-controlled capture and release of metal ions, as well reversible chromism induced by solvation/desolvation. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

By IR spectroscopy, it was shown that the light-induced trans/cis isomerization of AZB in these hybrid host-guest compounds is improved compared to that of solid AZB. A population of the excited cis state up to 30% has been obtained for AZB0.66@MIL-68(In). However, no light-induced trans/cis isomerization was observed for AZB0.5@MIL-53(Al). Structural models obtained from high-resolution synchrotron powder diffraction data show that AZB molecules are densely packed within the channels of MIL-53(Al) so that no trans/cis isomerization can occur. A different situation was observed for AZB in the larger channels of MIL-68(Ga).

The CRYSTAL code was used to compute the single-crystal elastic constants Cij of the (orthorhombic) ZIF-4 and (tetragonal) ZIF-zni structures at the PBE level of theory. Through tensorial analysis of the Cij, we reveal the three-dimensional representation surfaces of the Young's modulus, shear modulus, Poisson's ratio and linear compressibility, which enable us to describe the detailed elasticity behaviour and to pinpoint basic crystal structure-property correlations. Notably, we discover that ZIF-4 can potentially exhibit a negative Poisson's ratio, thereby representing the first example of an 'auxetic-ZIF' to be identified to date. Furthermore, we show that our DFT predictions are consistent with recently reported experimental measurements of the Young's and bulk moduli of such complex ZIF structures. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

abstract={We report the synthesis and characterization of the new switchable Zn-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) [Zn(Im)(aIm)] (1). The high-throughput investigation of the mixed linker system Zn2+/imidazole (HIm)/2-phenylazoimidazole (HaIm)/DMF at 85 °C led to 1, which is isostructural to ZIF-8 and crystallizes in a sodalite (SOD)-type structure. The preparation was also studied with microwave-assisted heating and ultrasound-assisted synthesis. The crystal structure was determined from single-crystal X-ray diffraction data. Although Im- and aIm - ions are present in a 1:1 molar ratio, no ordering of the 2-phenylazo group was observed. Incorporation of the Im- and aIm - linkers as an integral part of the framework structure was confirmed by elemental analysis, 13C and 15N MAS NMR, IR and Raman spectroscopy. In addition, the permanent porosity of 1 was demonstrated by N2 sorption experiments and a specific surface area of SBET = 580 m2g-1 is observed. The photoswitching properties were investigated by UV/Vis spectroscopy as the cis and trans isomers exhibit different UV absorption spectra. Switching can be achieved by irradiation with UV light (λ = 355 nm), and back-switching using visible light (λ = 525 nm). Although changes in the UV/Vis spectra are detected, the switching process is only partially reversible. © 2011 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

abstract={Previous high-pressure experiments have shown that pressure-transmitting fluids composed of small molecules can be forced inside the pores of metal organic framework materials, where they can cause phase transitions and amorphization and can even induce porosity in conventionally nonporous materials. Here we report a combined high-pressure diffraction and computational study of the structural response to methanol uptake at high pressure on a scandium terephthalate MOF (Sc2BDC3, BDC = 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate) and its nitro-functionalized derivative (Sc 2(NO2-BDC)3) and compare it to direct compression behavior in a nonpenetrative hydrostatic fluid, Fluorinert-77. In Fluorinert-77, Sc2BDC3 displays amorphization above 0.1 GPa, reversible upon pressure release, whereas Sc2(NO 2-BDC)3 undergoes a phase transition (C2/c to Fdd2) to a denser but topologically identical polymorph. In the presence of methanol, the reversible amorphization of Sc2BDC3 and the displacive phase transition of the nitro-form are completely inhibited (at least up to 3 GPa). Upon uptake of methanol on Sc2BDC3, the methanol molecules are found by diffraction to occupy two sites, with preferential relative filling of one site compared to the other: grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations support these experimental observations, and molecular dynamics simulations reveal the likely orientations of the methanol molecules, which are controlled at least in part by H-bonding interactions between guests. As well as revealing the atomistic origin of the stabilization of these MOFs against nonpenetrative hydrostatic fluids at high pressure, this study demonstrates a novel high-pressure approach to study adsorption within a porous framework as a function of increasing guest content, and so to determine the most energetically favorable adsorption sites. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={A scheme to predict as yet unknown, hypothetical covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from scratch by screening the possible space of supramolecular isomers is presented. This is achieved by extending our currently developed first principles derived force field MOF-FF with a parametrization for the boroxin unit. We considered four non-tetrahedral monomers with four boronic acid groups inspired by the corresponding carboxylate linkers known from metal-organic frameworks, and investigated the potential 3,4-connected topologies with edge-transitivity (ctn, bor, pto and tbo) or transitivity 32 (ofp, tfj, fjh, iab and nju). Due to the partly lower symmetry of the building blocks with respect to the vertex, beyond topological isomerism also isoreticular isomers are formed. We have used our reverse topological approach to construct the fictitious structures and employed an automated genetic algorithm based global minimum search approach to screen the vast configurational space of isoreticular isomerism and predicted a series of hypothetical 3D-COFs. All structures are completely relaxed by including the lattice parameters. From the atomistic structures, the accessible surface areas were determined, and, because of the isomer screening procedure, the question of crystallographic disorder could also be answered. Beyond the examples of hypothetical 3D-COFs serving as a lead for future synthetic investigations, this work is intended in particular to introduce the efficient predictive modeling method which can be applied to any kind of hypothetical COF system. © 2013 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

Whereas in the former the NTE response is uniaxial - occurring along the hexagonal crystal axis - this behaviour is inverted in the latter such that PTE occurs along the hexagonal axis and NTE is found in the entire plane of perpendicular directions. We show that this inversion of mechanical response can be explained on geometric grounds alone; specifically, we identify a critical framework geometry that demarcates a switch from linear to area NTE response. Extending this analysis to other common MOF topologies, we establish a generic predictive approach for establishing the dimensionality of NTE (or, by extension, negative compressibility) responses in a large range of different framework systems. Our analysis suggests that framework geometry plays a crucial role in determining the mechanical response of framework materials which show anisotropic responses via hinging. © 2014 the Partner Organisations.},

abstract={We report a structural and thermodynamic investigation of the phase behavior of Ga(OH,F)-MIL-53, a gallium-based metal-organic framework (MOF) having the MIL-53 topology containing 0.7 wt % fluorine bonded to the metal. Despite some small structural differences, especially for the hydrated form, the overall physical chemistry behavior of Ga(OH,F)-MIL-53 is very similar to standard fluorine free Ga-MIL-53 material. A combination of in situ X-ray diffraction, in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and heat capacity measurements allowed us to establish that Ga(OH,F)-MIL-53 under vacuum (i.e., the empty material) exhibits two stable phases: A nonporous narrow-pore (np) phase favored at low temperature and a large-pore (lp) phase favored at high temperature, accompanied by a huge hysteresis effect. Structure determination of the hydrated material Ga(OH,F)-MIL-53-np-H2O obtained after synthesis, activation, and rehydration was also performed. Density functional theory calculations show that it is not a stable structure of Ga(OH,F)-MIL-53 in the absence of adsorbed water molecules. Instead, this hydrated structure is a swollen variant of the np phase, where the flexible framework has expanded to accommodate water molecules. © 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Metal-organic frameworks demonstrate a wide variety of behavior in their response to pressure, which can be classified in a rather limited list of categories, including anomalous elastic behavior (e.g., negative linear compressibility, NLC), transitions between crystalline phases, and amorphization. Very few of these mechanisms involve bond rearrangement. Here, we report two novel piezo-mechanical responses of metal-organic frameworks, observed under moderate pressure in two materials of the zinc alkyl gate (ZAG) family. Both materials exhibit NLC at high pressure, due to a structural transition involving a reversible proton transfer between an included water molecule and the linkers phosphonate group. In addition, the 6-carbon alkyl chain of ZAG-6 exhibits a coiling transition under pressure. These phenomena are revealed by combining high-pressure single-crystal X-ray crystallography and quantum mechanical calculations. They represent novel pressure responses for metal-organic frameworks, and pressure-induced proton transfer is a very rare phenomenon in materials in general. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={The Al-MOF CAU-13 ([Al(OH)(trans-CDC)]; trans-H2CDC = trans-1,4-cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid) is structurally related to the MIL-53 compounds that are well-known for their "breathing" behavior, i.e., the framework flexibility upon external stimuli such as the presence of adsorbate molecules. The adsorption properties of CAU-13 were investigated in detail. The sorption isotherms of N2, H2, CH4, CO, CO2, and water were recorded, and the adsorption enthalpies for the gases were determined by microcalorimetry. The structural changes upon adsorption of CO2 were followed with in situ synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The patterns were analyzed by parametric unit cell refinement, and the preferential arrangement of the CO2 molecules was modeled by density functional theory calculations. The adsorption and separation of mixtures of o-, m-, and p-xylene from mesitylene showed a preferred adsorption of o-xylene. The structures of o/m/p-xylene-loaded CAU-13 were determined from PXRD data. The adsorption of xylene isomers induces a larger pore opening than that in the thermal activation of CAU-13. In the crystal structure of the activated sample CAU-13(empty pore), half of the linkers adopt the a,a confirmation and the other half the e,e conformation, and the presence of a,a-CDC2- ions hampers the structural flexibility of CAU-13. However, after the adsorption of xylene, all linkers are present in the e,e conformation, allowing for a wider pore opening by this new type of "breathing". © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Understanding the crystal-size dependence of both guest adsorption and structural transitions of nanoporous solids is crucial to the development of these materials. We find that nano-sized metal-organic framework (MOF) crystals have significantly different guest adsorption properties compared to the bulk material. A new methodology is developed to simulate the adsorption and transition behavior of entire MOF nanoparticles. Our simulations predict that the transition pressure significantly increases with decreasing particle size, in agreement with crystal-size-dependent experimental measurements of the N2-ZIF-8 system. We also propose a simple core-shell model to examine this effect on length scales that are inaccessible to simulations and again find good agreement with experiments. This study is the first to examine particle size effects on structural transitions in ZIFs and provides a thermodynamic framework for understanding the underlying mechanism. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={Flexible metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are materials of great current interest. A small class of MOFs show flexibility driven by reversible bonding rearrangements that lead directly to unusual properties. Cu-SIP-3 is a MOF based on the 5-sulfoisophthalate ligand, where the strong copper-carboxylate bonds ensure that the three-dimensional integrity of the structure is retained while allowing bonding changes to occur at the more weakly bonding sulfonate group leading to unusual properties such as the ultra-selective adsorption of only certain gases. While the integrity of the framework remains intact during bonding changes, crystalline order is not retained at all times during the transformations. X-Ray diffraction reveals that highly crystalline single crystals lose order during the transformation before regaining crystallinity once it is complete. Here we show how X-ray pair distribution function analysis can be used to reveal the mechanism of the transformations in Cu-SIP-3, identifying the sequence of atomic displacements that occur in the disordered phase. A similar approach reveals the underlying mechanism of Cu-SIP-3's ultra-selective gas adsorption. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.},

abstract={The taste sensing capabilities of a "biomimetic tongue" based on the photoluminescence (PL) responses of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), [In(OH)(bdc)]n (bdc=1,4-benzenedicarboxylate), [Tb(btc)]n (MOF-76, btc=benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxylate), and [Ca3(btc)2(DMF)2(H2O)2]·3H2O are proven on aqueous solutions of five basic tastants: sucrose (sweet), caffeine (bitter), citric acid (sour), sodium chloride (salty) and monosodium glutamate (umami). For [In(OH)(bdc)]n, the tastant interacts stereochemically with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and alters its conformations. The frequency and magnitude of chelation between COO- pendant groups of PAA and In3+ nodes of [In(OH)(bdc)]n framework influence the corresponding PL reponses. For MOF-76, the tastant interacts with incorporated water in MOF-76 through hydrogen bonding. The limitation of O-H bond stretching of water results in the enhancement of the PL intensity. For [Ca3(BTC)2(DMF)2(H2O)2]·3H2O, it is added as a third MOF component to increase the precision on taste discrimination. The significance of MOF-based "biomimetic tongue" includes: (1) PAA on [In(OH)(bdc)]n mimics the taste receptor cells (TRCs) for their structural flexibility, (2) the Weber-Fechner law of human sensing that sensation is proportional to the logarithm of the stimulus intensity is observed between the PL emission response of MOF-76 and the concentration of tastant, (3) the strength of taste is quantified by the τ scale and the PL emission intensity of MOF-76, which are dependent on the logarithmic tastant concentration, (4) the tastant is identified by the shape of the 3D principal component analysis contour map (i.e., pattern recognition method), and (5) the fabrication of [In(OH)(bdc)]n/PAA film by brushing is illustrated. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We construct a simple Hamiltonian that describes the physics of host-host and host-guest interactions on the level of unit cells and reduces to one effective dimension due to the long-range elastic cell-cell interactions. We then use this Hamiltonian in Monte Carlo simulations of adsorption-desorption cycles to study how the behavior of unit cells is linked to the transition mechanism at the crystal level through three key physical parameters: the transition energy barrier, the cell-cell elastic coupling, and the system size. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={Metal-organic materials (MOFs) constitute very attractive materials for storage, separation, catalysis, and drug delivery because of their crystalline hybrid organic-inorganic structures and their large porous volume. Here, we report the energetic behavior, in term of storage/restoration of mechanical energy, of ZIF-8 upon high pressure intrusion-extrusion of aqueous KCl, LiCl, and NaCl solutions of variable concentration. Comparison with the energetic performances of the "ZIF-8-water" system is performed. Whatever the nature of the electrolyte (KCl, LiCl, NaCl), an increase of the intrusion pressures and thereby of the stored energy are observed with the increasing of salt concentration. However, the three studied systems differ, at least for the highest concentrations, by behaving as a shock-absorber for KCl and as a bumper for NaCl and LiCl. A combination of several characterization techniques used before and after intrusion-extrusion experiments, i.e., X-ray diffraction, solid state NMR, and N2 adsorption-desorption experiments, allows us to establish that the ZIF-8 network is preserved after such a treatment. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

Conventional X-ray crystallography allows for the determination of each structural phase emerged during transformation. However, the propagation mechanism of transformation through an entire crystal still remains in question. Here we elucidate the structural nature of the spatial transient state, in which two different but correlated framework structures, an original phase and a deformed phase, simultaneously exist in one crystal. The deformed phase is distinctively generated only at the crystal surface region by introducing large guest molecules, while the remaining part of crystal containing small molecules maintains the original phase. By means of grazing incidence diffraction techniques we determine that the framework is sheared with sharing one edge of the original primitive cubic structure, leading to the formation of crystal domains with four mirror image relationships. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

By changing the adsorbent history, parent MIL-53(Al) is tuned into its np domain at ambient temperature such that it not only exhibits a significant increase in CO2 capacity, but also shows negligible uptake for CH4, N2, CO, and O2 at subatmospheric pressure.

abstract={Through the systematic investigation of zinc alkylbisphosphonates, four new structural families have been obtained. These families are named zinc alkyl-tunnel, -gate, -cation, and -sheet (ZAT, ZAG, ZAC, and ZAS) for convenience and have been synthesized and further extended through isoreticular design utilizing alkylbis(phosphonic acid) ligands of the formula H 2O3PCnH2nPO3H 2 (n = 3-6) (H4Ln). Both even- and odd-length chains were utilized to help determine the effect of chain conformation on structure formation. The investigation lead to two known compounds (ZAG-4, and ZAS-3) and nine new compounds, two of which contain large 1-D channels. The crystal structures of all compounds were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Of the nine new compounds, only seven of them fall into the new families. In three of the four families, the structure is controlled by alkyl-chain length and conformation (i.e., odd vs even), and in the fourth, a conformational distortion allows both odd and even lengths to form the given structure. Isoreticular species using n = 3 and 5 were obtained in both the ZAT and the ZAS families; using n = 4 and 6 were obtained in the ZAG family; and n = 4-6, in the ZAC family. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},

abstract={High-pressure guest-dependent behaviors of porous coordination polymer {[Cu(CO3)2](CH6N3)2} n (GCC) are investigated using synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman techniques. In GCC, the host framework of 3D [Cu(CO3) 2]2- coordination network presents a diamond-like topology, with guest guanidinium cations locating at the window of the pores through N-H···O hydrogen bonds. Above a critical pressure, the external force can squeeze the guanidinium ions into the pores, leading to the abnormal expansion of the structure. Meanwhile, the critical pressure for expansion can be effectively lowered when no pressure transmitting medium is employed. Moreover, nonhydrostatic effects can promote the insertion of guanidinium ions, along with the amorphization of the structure, and thus affect the reversibility of the structure after releasing the pressure. Our results show that pressure is an effective tool to tune the host-guest relationship and to prepare high-pressure phase host-guest materials. Meanwhile, this study broadens the understanding of host-guest chemistry and offers a new strategy for fabricating novel materials with applications of pressure switches and zero contraction material in porous coordination polymers. © 2014 American Chemical Society.},
