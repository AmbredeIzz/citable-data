We construct the relationship between pressure and chemical potential of water in electrolyte solutions, using density as an intermediate quantity.

- In "NPT_pressure_density_gromacs" we performed MD simulations of electrolyte solutions (600 particles) to retrieve the relationship between density and pressure.
- After extracting the density, we deduce the side of the cubic box corresponding to 150 particles, stored in 'density_vs_pressure.ods'.
- The side of the cubic box is then used to perform MC simulations in 'Chemical_potential_water_RASPA' where the chemical potenial of water is calculated.
