**In "osmostat_electrolytes_NCMC":**

- There is the patch of RASPA with the osmostat implemented inside in the file "RASPA". Its installation can be done by following the user guide of RASPA, the procedure is exactly the same.
- In "calibration_osmostat", input files are given to perform calculations of the protocol works and chemical potentials for all series of electrolytes.
- In "MC_osmotic_ensemble_from_bulk_water_to_electrolytes", input files are given to perform MC simulations in the osmostic ensemble where CsCl electrolytes are inserted in a system initially constituted of pure TIP4P water.
