**In "insertion_water_NCMC":**

- There is the patch of RASPA with the NCMC move implemented inside to insert 2 water molecules in bulk water (calculation of free energy of water solvation). Its installation can be done by following the user guide of RASPA, the procedure is exactly the same.
- In "insertion_water", input files are given to perform calculations of free energy of water solvation in bulk water.
