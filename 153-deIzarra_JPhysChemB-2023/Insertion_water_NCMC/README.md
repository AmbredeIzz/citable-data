**In "Insertion_water_NCMC":**

- In "RASPA_insertion_water_NCMC" is provided the updated files of the source code of RASPA where the NCMC move is adapted to insert 2 water molecules in bulk water (calculation of free energy of water solvation). In order to install the patch, copy the files in RASPA_insertion_water_NCMC/src in RASPA2-master/src after having downloaded the unmodified and extracted the RASPA2-master version from https://github.com/iRASPA/RASPA2.
- In "Simulation_insertion_water_NCMC", input files are given to perform calculations of free energy of water solvation in bulk water, using above patch of RASPA.
