- Simulations were performed using the open-source lattice Boltzmann code [laboetie](https://github.com/maxlevesque/laboetie). Simulations reported in this paper were performed with a modified version of the code, on branch [`jmvanson`](https://github.com/maxlevesque/laboetie/tree/jmvanson), commit [`809d0b7`](https://github.com/maxlevesque/laboetie/commit/809d0b7).
