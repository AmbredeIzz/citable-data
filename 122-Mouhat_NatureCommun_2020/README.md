**Paper history**

This paper was first posted as a [preprint on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04987).

**Movies**

- [`movie_1.mp4`](movie_1.mp4): Movie showing several proton exchanges between the surface hydroxyl groups and the surrounding H<sub>2</sub>O molecules present in the bulk.
- [`movie_2.mp4`](movie_2.mp4): Movie showing the dehydration reaction that is observed in the trajectory of the semi-ordered 4 graphene oxide model in liquid water.

**Structures**

- The models of graphene oxide created in this work are found in the [`GO`](GO) directory. As in the paper, they are classified in [random](GO/random) and [semi-ordered](GO/semi_ordered), and 5 models of each type were created. For each model, we provide coordinates in an `GO.xyz` file (in XYZ format) and cell parameters in a `cell_parameters.dat` file (in ångströms).
- The most stable models were then hydrated by adding H<sub>2</sub>O molecules, the resulting models are found in the [`GO_with_water`](GO_with_water) directory. The layout is the same as above.
